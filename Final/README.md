# COVID-19 Detection

A Covid-19 machine learning detection algorithm.

The goal of this project was to create and train a fully-connected network (FCN) model (utilizing a pre-trained ResNet-50 base) to be able to classify CT-scans of lungs into three categories, ``Healthy``, ``Other``, and ``Covid``.
